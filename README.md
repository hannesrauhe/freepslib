# freepslib

Go-library to interact with your fritzbox.

Mostly an implementation of https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AHA-HTTP-Interface.pdf

## Reference

* fritzbox_upnp is copied from [https://github.com/sberk42/fritzbox_exporter](https://github.com/sberk42/fritzbox_exporter/tree/282fbbbd0efac73b2cf5f31f300a27c6da00c481/fritzbox_upnp) because freepslib does not need all the other dependencies from this repo.
* [Freeps](https://github.com/hannesrauhe/freeps) is a small home automation tool that was built around freepslib.
